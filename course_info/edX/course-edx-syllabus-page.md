### Discussion Forum Etiquette

This course contains regular discussion sections, each with key prompts given in the unit text. We advise that you create a single post in a sub-topic to answer all of the questions posed for that topic, and use replies to other posts to comment on your fellow learners' work.

We expect everyone participating in our courses to be respectful of others, and not to use words or share content that is offensive or inflammatory. Remember that other people on the course may come from a different background to you, and will bring different experiences, knowledge and abilities to the course.

Also, be aware that communicating online only through text can lead to misunderstandings. Try to give other people the benefit of the doubt, respond kindly, and remember that you may not know or appreciate the situation that someone else is in.

We believe that it is everyone’s responsibility to ensure we have an inclusive and welcoming environment that everyone can learn in. As such, we expect you to report any comments which you think are not appropriate. A member of the team will then review the post and take suitable action.

### Course facilitation

The course team will be checking through the discussion forums, responding to questions and providing feedback. However the course will not be checked over the weekends, on UK Bank Holidays, or between XXX CHRISTMAS SHUTDOWNXXX. As our facilitation team are based in the UK, facilitation will occur during working hours in BST/GMT.

The facilitators will not respond to every comment, but will do their best to support your learning.
