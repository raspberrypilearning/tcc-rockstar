Before you begin your course, we would like to introduce you to the team and the work we do here at the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

We are a UK-based computing education charity with the mission to enable young people to realise their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies. We work to:

+ Enable all schools and organisations that work with young people to teach them about computing and how to create with digital technologies, through providing the best possible curriculum, resources, and training for educators
+ Inspire millions of young people to learn about computing and how to create with digital technologies outside school, through online resources and apps, clubs, competitions, and partnerships with youth organisations
+ Develop our understanding of how young people learn about computing and how to create with digital technologies, and use that knowledge to increase the impact of our work and advance the field of computing education

Here are some of the free resources and opportunities we offer:

+ More [online training courses](https://www.raspberrypi.org/courses/) like this one
+ [The Computing Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum), a complete set of classroom resources for educators to use with learners aged 5 to 16, mapped to the English computing curriculum
+ [Ada Computer Science](https://adacomputerscience.org/), a platform for upper secondary school educators and learners around the world, offering world-leading computing education resources for the classroom, homework, and revision
+ [Experience AI](https://experience-ai.org/), cutting-edge education resources on AI and machine learning for secondary school educators and learners, to support and inspire them
+ [Hello World](https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world), a computing and digital making magazine where the content is made by educators for educators, with special collections and a podcast too
+ [Monthly online research seminars](https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars) where educators and researchers discuss the latest understanding around what works in computing education
+ Support for running [Code Clubs](https://codeclub.org/)
+ The [European Astro Pi Challenge](https://astro-pi.org/), an annual challenge where young people write code and experiments that run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the International Space Station
+ Fun and interesting [digital making project tutorials](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/)
+ Coolest Projects, our world-leading technology showcase, where young people around the world share their tech creations and celebrate their achievements:
  + The annual [Coolest Projects online showcase](https://online.coolestprojects.org/) is open to creators all over the world
  + [In-person Coolest Projects events](https://online.coolestprojects.org/take-part) are held in certain countries

### Know your course team

At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our team includes former and current computing educators, adult learning content developers, and computing education researchers, who have used their experience to create these courses. They are excited to support you throughout this course, and encourage you to join in as much as possible.

### Introduce yourself

The best way to learn is with other amazing people.

With this in mind, please **introduce yourself to your fellow learners by posting in the discussion**. To help you get started, include your answers to some of these questions:

+ Why did you decide to take the course?
+ What are you hoping to learn?
+ What will you do to ensure that you will complete the course? For example, you might set aside some 'do not disturb' time in your schedule each week, or invite a colleague to take the course with you.

You can also reply to your fellow learners in the discussion. Together, we will build a community of educators who share ideas and inspire each other to learn along the way.
