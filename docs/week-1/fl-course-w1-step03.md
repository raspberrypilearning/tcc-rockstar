## Cultural relevance
It's essential to recognise that we all come from different backgrounds that affect how we teach and learn. Don't be afraid to adapt the contents of this course to suit your learners.

By valuing the diversity and specific interests of your learners, you will be able to make your teaching more accessible, relevant, and interesting, as well as give your learners a greater sense of ownership of their learning. As you work through the course activities, think about how you can include elements of your own unique context and broader experiences while still meeting the objectives of the tasks.

### Reflection activity
To help you make the most of this course, try a short self-reflection exercise. Consider the different experiences listed below that you may have had, which make up your identity. This will give you an opportunity to reflect on your own influences, knowledge, and values and how these may inform the way you can effectively interact with the young people you work with. You don't need to share your thoughts with anyone else. The reflections are for you to look back on as you work through the course.

**Educator experience:** What practical, hands-on experience have you gained through teaching? This includes classroom management, teaching strategies, curriculum development, and communication with learners, colleagues, and parents.

**Life experience:** What is your personal history and cultural background? What significant life events and varied roles have you experienced outside of your professional identity as an educator? This can include experiences such as travel, family life, social groups, hobbies, community involvement, experiences of adversity, and other important events that contribute to your worldview and how you connect with others.

**Knowledge/expertise:** What do you know, and what can you do well? What do you need to learn more about, and how do you use the skills and knowledge you have?

**Beliefs:** Which ideas do you feel are true about teaching and learning? Think about how your beliefs guide you in your work and how they align with your school's way of teaching.

**Values:** Values are the ideas and beliefs you have that help you decide what is right and wrong and how to act in different situations. How do these values shape the way you live your life? Do they fit with what you think is important?

**Challenges:** What difficulties or problems have you encountered in your life? How did you deal with them, and how can you solve similar problems in the future?

Fill in this diagram with your answers about how each aspect influences your teaching practice:

### Informing your teaching
Now that you have reflected on what makes you the person you are, the next step is to think about the effect this has on how you act as an educator. For example, if you are an experienced user of automated systems, you may find it harder to demonstrate the potential negative impacts of these systems for your learners.

Take a moment to consider how the aspects you thought about in the previous exercise might affect the way you share knowledge with others.

Your ideas, skills, and experiences influence your teaching. Equally, your learners have their own unique backgrounds and personalities. In this course, you will find activities and real-world examples that might not always suit your learners perfectly, so it is important to adjust your teaching methods to engage your learners.
