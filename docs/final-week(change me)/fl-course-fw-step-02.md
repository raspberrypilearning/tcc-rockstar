It’s important to take some time out to reflect on what you’ve learnt so far.

People who take time to reflect on their learning are much more likely to make use of it later. Not only that, but by sharing your reflections with us and our team at the Raspberry Pi Foundation you will help to make our courses even better. With that in mind, we’d like you to fill in our reflection form below. It will help you to make connections between all the new knowledge you have taken in and find new ways to apply your learning. It only takes a few minutes.

*All the information collected will be stored and handled according to the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s [privacy policy](https://www.raspberrypi.org/privacy/). If you choose to share your contact details, they will only be used for the purposes described. The information you share will be used by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help evaluate our courses. Your participation has no effect on your course progress, marks, or edX profile.*
