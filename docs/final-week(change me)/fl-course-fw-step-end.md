## End of the course

Congratulations on completing the course! 

You’ve learnt how to think more like a programmer, plan out algorithms, and implement them in code with reusable functions. You’ve learnt how to use lists in Python, and about the importance of commenting your code. You’ve also created implementations of sort and search algorithms, and reflected on their relative efficiency.

We hope you’ve enjoyed this course and feel that it’s given you new skills to use in your programming. Good luck with all of your future projects.

### Teaching this course material

For those of you who are teachers, support and materials for teaching the topics covered in this course can be found in the [XXX unit]() of [The Computing Curriculum](http://raspberrypi.org/curriculum/).

The Computing Curriculum contains everything you need to teach computing computing to children aged between 5 and 16, including lesson plans, slides, worksheets, homework and assessment.

All of the content is completely free to access, and has been created by subject experts, based on the latest pedagogical research and teacher feedback. It provides an innovative progression framework where computing content (concepts, knowledge, skills, and objectives) have been organised into interconnected networks called learning graphs.
