When learners are asked to share code they should use the *markdown in comments* feature of FutureLearn so code is correctly formatted and readable.

Advice on how to share code should be included in the course content. A high-level of support should be given the first time a learner is asked to share their code. The level of support included in the course text should be reduced as the learner progresses and becomes more competent.

## First step where learners are asked to share their code

Share your code ...

To include code in comments, you will have to use three tilde characters (`~~~`) before and after your code, as in this example comment text:

<pre><code>I created this program.

~~~
print("This is my code")
~~~
</code></pre>

## Second step 

Share your code ...

Remember to use three tilde characters (`~~~`) at the start and end of your code, as in this example comment text:

<pre><code>I created this program.

~~~
print("This is my code")
~~~
</code></pre>

## Subsequent steps

Share your code ...

**Note:** Code in comments should be enclosed in tilde characters (`~~~`) â€” three tildes before and after the code. Refer to our ['Sharing code on FutureLearn' guide](https://rpf-futurelearn.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/all+courses+/Sharing+code+on+FutureLearn.pdf) for more information.
