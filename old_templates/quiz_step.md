Ignore case sensitivity for answers: Y/N
Ignore commas for answers: Y/N


#### Cloze Question:
[comment]: # (Text with two underscores for each blank space)
Something like this where you have a __ (two underscores) to fill in. Quite often there are __ than one. Annoyingly this shows up terribly in markdown, so ignore the preview here and just put in two underscores for each gap.

+ gap
+ space
+ blank
+ hole
    + Feedback for this blank space e.g. Can you think of a word for what you are filling in here?


+ more
    + Could you have less than 1?


#### Overall question feedback:
Appears with both right and wrong answers, above the specific answer feedback. Again, use markdown. e.g. It's important to leave a **gap** in the right place as you can't modify cloze question statements on FutureLearn without deleting them.
