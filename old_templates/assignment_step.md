## Assignment Guidelines:

You must give 3 assignment guidelines, in the form of questions for the peer reviewer to answer in the peer review step. These should be open questions e.g.:

1. How well does the resource cover the concepts chosen?
2. How has the author tailored the resource for the planned audience?
3. What types of scaffolding has the author used to help the learners to complete the task?
