Perhaps you'll want to reference some `code` in-line.

Sometimes you'll want to write a chunk of it:

~~~ python
Some python code
More code
if this looks OK:
	do this
else:
	blah

How to format different bits of code:

# imports
from library import SpecificClass, or_function

# constants
ALL_IN_CAPS = 1

# variables
snake_case_in_lower_case = 1

# function names
def a_name_in_lower_case()

#class names
class CapitalisedClassNames

1. A numbered point
2. A second
3. A third. *Hooray!*
